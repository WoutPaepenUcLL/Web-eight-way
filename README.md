# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a project that experiments with React, TypeScript, Three JS Fiber.

## The goal?

The goal is to create a simple 3D scene using Three JS Fiber and React.
I want to keep adding features like flatrides, rollercoasters, and more.
Typescript and Three JS is pretty limited in terms of documentation, so I want to create a project that can be used as a reference for others.

## How to run?

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Enjoy!

## How i see this project in the future?

I want to keep adding features to this project, like rollercoasters, flatrides, and more.
But I am pretty limited in terms of technical knowlegde in this area, so I will keep learning and adding features as I learn more about Three JS Fiber and React.
So, if you want to contribute, feel free to do so!
